      <h2>About Rastro Flamenco...</h2>
      <div class="about-pane">
        <p>Rastro Flamenco is a market place for all things flamenco! Inspired by visits to the Rastro in Madrid,
           and El Jueves market in Sevilla, we aim to offer a full range of new and used flamenco items, including
           costumes, practice wear, shoes, castanets and a wide array of accessories. Like any good "segundo mano"
           market, many items are one of a kind and we do not stock multiple sizes. Part of the fun is in finding
           that item that is just right for you! Enjoy browsing, and check back often as our inventory changes quickly!</p>
